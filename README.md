Title: Secure Key API Gateway (Java Servlet)

Description:
This project implements a secure API gateway that provides access to protected resources based on access keys. Users with valid access keys can request API access tokens, which are then used to authenticate subsequent requests.

Features:
1. Access key-based authentication: Requires valid access keys for authorization.
2. API access token generation: Issues API access tokens upon successful authentication.
3. Resource protection: Restricts access to protected resources based on valid API access tokens.
4. Token expiration: Implements token expiration to enhance security.
5. Java Servlet-based implementation: Leverages the Java Servlet API for flexible and scalable deployment.

Prerequisites:
1. Java 8 or later
2. Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty)
3. Required Java libraries (e.g., JSON Web Token (JWT), database driver)
4. A supported database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

Usage:
Obtain an access key:
Register a user with the API gateway to obtain an access key.

Request an API access token:
1. Send a POST request to /api/token with the access key as a query parameter or in the request body.
2. The API gateway will return an API access token if the access key is valid.

Access protected resources:
1. Include the API access token in the authorization header of subsequent requests.
2. The API gateway will verify the token and grant access to the requested resource if it is valid.

Security Considerations:
1. Access key management: Store access keys securely and implement strong password policies.
2. Token expiration: Set appropriate token expiration times to limit the lifetime of access tokens.
3. Token revocation: Provide a mechanism to revoke access tokens if they are compromised.
4. Rate limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service attacks.
5. HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
